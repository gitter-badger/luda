  Once upon time a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire.  It was she who cooked the meals. It was she who kept the fire going. The poor girl could not stay clean, from all the ashes and cinders by the fire.
</p>
<p>
  One day, big news came to town.  The King and Queen were going to have a ball!  It was time for the Prince to find a bride. All of the young ladies in the land were invited to come.  They were wild with joy! They would wear their most beautiful gown and fix their hair extra nice. Maybe the prince would like them!

  <p>
    Avian carriers can provide high delay, low
    throughput, and low altitude service.  The
    connection topology is limited to a single
    point-to-point path for each carrier, used with
    standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
    without significant interference with each other,
    outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D
    ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
    to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3.  The carriers
    have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which
    increases availability.
