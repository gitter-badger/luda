description: Enhance the behavior of the tab key for a better interaction experience.

## Introduction
Radios can be focused through the arrow keys in native HTML, many users don't know this. In Luda, we enhanced the behavior of the `Tab` key to focus radios more easily.

When a radio is focused, the next radio has the same `name` attribute can be focused when the `Tab` key pressed and the prev radio has the same `name` attribute can be focused when the `Tab` key and the `Shift` key pressed together.

Let's see the below examples.


## Examples

Press the `Tab` key alone or with the `Shift` together to focus these radios.
{% capture tabulate %}
<div class="fm fm-radio">
  <label><input type="radio" name="tabulate" value="one">One</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="tabulate" value="two">Two</label>
</div>
{% endcapture %}
<div class="example mt-none">
  {{ tabulate }}
</div>
``` html{{ tabulate }}```





## HTML Attributes

### data-tabulate-disabled

``` html
<html data-tabulate-disabled>...</html>
```
Add this attribute to the `<html>` tag to disable the enhancement of the `Tab` key.
