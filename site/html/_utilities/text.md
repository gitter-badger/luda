## Text Alignment
Text alignment utilities are extended with [the screen width breakpoint postfixes]({{ width_breakpoints }}) for responsive control. They are named using the format `.ta-{direction}-{breakpoint}`. Let's preview their effects in the below examples.

{% capture left %}
<p class="ta-left">
  Once upon time a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire...
</p>
{% endcapture %}
<div class="example">
  {{ left }}
</div>
``` html{{ left }}```

{% capture right %}
<p class="ta-right">
  Once upon time a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire...
</p>
{% endcapture %}
<div class="example">
  {{ right }}
</div>
``` html{{ right }}```

{% capture center %}
<p class="ta-center">
  Once upon time a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire...
</p>
{% endcapture %}
<div class="example">
  {{ center }}
</div>
``` html{{ center }}```


{% capture justify %}
<p class="ta-justify">
  Once upon time a girl named Cinderella lived with her stepmother and two stepsisters.  Poor Cinderella had to work hard all day long so the others could rest. It was she who had to wake up each morning when it was still dark and cold to start the fire...
</p>
{% endcapture %}
<div class="example">
  {{ justify }}
</div>
``` html{{ justify }}```


## Font Weight
Font weight utility classes are named using the format `.fw-{value}`. We use meaningful value words in the class names, all the value words are listed in the below table.

<div class="table table-border my-small">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Word</th><th>Value</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>lightest</td><td>100</td></tr>
      <tr><td>lighter</td><td>200</td></tr>
      <tr><td>light</td><td>300</td></tr>
      <tr><td>regular</td><td>400</td></tr>
      <tr><td>medium</td><td>500</td></tr>
      <tr><td>semibold</td><td>600</td></tr>
      <tr><td>bold</td><td>700</td></tr>
      <tr><td>bolder</td><td>800</td></tr>
      <tr><td>boldest</td><td>900</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

When you use font weight utilities, make sure the value words you pick up are supported by the fonts you embeded in your projects. Otherwise, the font weight effects will not be visible.

Let's preview the effects in the below examples.
